Technology Consultant & Application Craftsman

## Projects

### Question and Answers Website

I work part-time for a startup that is building a unique knowledge-sharing application. 
As the CTO, I provide strategic technical advice and help manage an off-shore development team.

### Learner Portal

I built the front end for a self-service learner portal using Vue. 
The portal allows thousands of real-estate agents to manage their 
enrollment in continuing education courses and significantly reduces 
the need for phone-based support.

### Custom Shopping Cart

For a client with more than 30,000 users and multiple websites, 
I built a single sign-on solution that unified their user accounts 
and allowed users to sign in with one-time codes. I also rebuilt 
their custom shopping cart using Vue with TypeScript. The new cart 
fixed numerous errors that were difficult to trace in their old 
jQuery-based cart, and improved the testability of the code.

### OpenID Authority
https://github.com/SimpleIAM/OpenIdAuthority

I created OpenID Authority to help organizations that need a simple single sign-on solution.
OpenID Authority leverages the IdentityServer4 project to provide a certified implementation of the OpenID Connect protocol,
but unlike IdentityServer4, it is a complete identity management solution. 
It provides advanced security and convenient passwordless logins for a safe and easy user experience. 
If you're thinking about implementing a single sign-on solution like Auth0, 
contact me to find out how you can get massive savings with this self-hosted solution.

### Custom Access and Identity Management Solution

While working for the State of Oregon I designed and 
led a small team to build a single sign-on identity and access
management system for 40,000 employees in more than 80
separate organizations. This system resolved numerous
security issues, reduced development time for new
applications, improved the experience of users, and saved up
to three million dollars in costs per year compared to
alternative solutions.

### ePayroll
Also for the State of Oregon I developed a mobile-first, responsive 
web interface for an online time
entry and approval application in .NET MVC and helped integrate it
with a legacy mainframe payroll system via web services.

### Hash Iteration Calculator
https://github.com/openidauthority/HashIterationCalculator

This is a simple open-source tool I created to help people tune ASP.NET Identity settings for their hardware. 
Many people skip this important step, which leaves their password data more vulnerable to attacks by password crackers.

### Get a Passphrase
https://getapassphrase.com

Still using weak passwords? Try out this passphrase generator I created. It creates
grammatically correct nonsense phrases that are millions of times
stronger than normal passwords.

### Protect Your Identity with Great Passwords
https://www.udemy.com/how-to-prevent-identity-theft-online-with-strong-passwords/

Speaking of passwords, did you realize that much of the advice you've heard from "experts" is flat out wrong?
Enroll in my short password security class to have your eyes opened to
how hackers actually work and how you can protect yourself and your users from modern threats.

### CSS 3D Web Book
https://openidauthority.com/portfolio/projects/webbook/index.html

Back when Adobe Flash was still popular, I created this responsive and interactive book entirely with CSS animations. 
Seriously. There is no JavaScript involved.
The original version was also a progressive web app.

### Extending an Open Multilingual Wordnet
http://aclweb.org/anthology/P13-1133

If you happen to be interested in Natural Language Processing, you'll find this paper that I coauthored an interesting read. 
It describing how I automatically built dozens of new wordnets from traditional word translation pairs extracted form Wiktionary.

### Your Project Here

If you're looking for a talented software engineer to help out on a project, get in touch. 
If I can't help you myself I'll try to connect you with someone else in my network who can.
